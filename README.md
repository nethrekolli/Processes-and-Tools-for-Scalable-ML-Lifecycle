# Processes-and-Tools-for-Scalable-ML-Lifecycle
## Introduction
* A lot of machine learning these days happens in the form of experiments, such as solving a novel problem with a novel architecture (algorithm).
* Model training in a distributed manner can enable us to speed up the model training on huge amount of data and enable us to experiment more and to be more creative.
* We can do this by creating a cluster of machines having same capacity. After creating the cluster, we can train our model in a distributed manner in this cluster which results in training our model faster. And we can also manage and scale our cluster based on the load.
## Objective
To build a scalable Machine Learning pipeline.
## Setup
Download and Install:
* Kubernetes
